The basilica’s dome, designed by Michelangelo, is an iconic symbol of Vatican City. Inside, visitors are treated to remarkable works of art, including Michelangelo’s Pietà and the intricately designed baldachin by Bernini.Adjacent to the basilica is the Vatican Museums, a vast complex that houses one of the world’s most impressive collections of art and historical artifacts. Among its highlights is the Sistine Chapel, famous for its breathtaking ceiling painted by Michelangelo, which depicts the Creation of Adam and various biblical scenes. The Chapel is also the site of the papal conclave, where new popes are elected.Vatican City is the spiritual epicenter for over a billion Catholics worldwide. It is home to the Pope, who serves as the spiritual leader and a key figure in promoting the teachings of the Church.
